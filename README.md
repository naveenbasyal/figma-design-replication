## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js 
- npm 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naveenbasyal/figma-design-replication.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `server` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

### Starting the Server

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Running the Client

1. Open the `client/index.html` file in your preferred code editor.

2. Use a live server extension (such as the one available in VS Code) to serve the `index.html` file.

   - For VS Code, right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
   - Alternatively, you can use any other method to serve the HTML file locally.

3. Once the live server is running, open your browser and navigate to the local server URL provided by the live server extension (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500/client/index.html`).
